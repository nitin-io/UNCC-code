## 3 main topics
- 1. Binary Number System (Base 2 Numbers)
- 2. Hexa Decimal Number System (Base 16 Numbers)
    We are learning this because Conversion between binary and hexadecimal is insanly simple. for 4 bit there is one hexadecimal character.
    0x is added in the starting of a hexadecimal number to indicate that it is a hexadecimal number.
- 3. Character Sets/Encoding
    Letters and symbols(character) that a writing system uses, and a representation of assingning different numbers to those characters.
    Unicode: A standard for representation and encoding characters in most of the writing systems worldwide. (149813 - version 15.1)
    ASCII: It defines 128 characters, lowercase and uppercase of letters a-z, numbers from 0 to 9, punctions and some control character like DEL (Delete);
    command to see ascii list: `man ascii`

    Character Encodings: A system of assigning a sequence of bytes (just some zeros and ones) to a character. 
    The most comman one is utf-8, defined by the Unicode Standard, therefore its character have the same numbers as the Unicode.
